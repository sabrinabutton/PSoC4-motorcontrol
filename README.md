# Motor Control with the Cypress PSoC 4
Basic motor control using the Cypress PSoC 4 and recycled servo motors from a previous project. This library is being created and applied in Cypress Creator.

The motor control library can be found in [control.h](https://github.com/sabrinabutton/PSoc4-motorcontrol/blob/master/control.h), and the program that applies this code can be found in [main.c](https://github.com/sabrinabutton/PSoc4-motorcontrol/blob/master/main.c).

This repository also includes a [Design Wide Resource file](https://github.com/sabrinabutton/PSoc4-motorcontrol/blob/master/MotorControl.cydwr), showing the physical connections of the pins to the board. The [Top Design file](https://github.com/sabrinabutton/PSoc4-motorcontrol/blob/master/TopDesign/TopDesign.cysch) is a schematic showing the pins hardware connections and displays their properties. These can both be opened with Cypress Creator. 

The servo motors and robot body that I am using in this project have been recycled from [this arduino project](https://github.com/sabrinabutton/microbit-arduino-communication).
